This error occurs when using the Expo Camera API with a custom resolution. The issue stems from providing a resolution that is not supported by the device's camera.  The error message may not always be explicit, sometimes leading to seemingly random crashes or unexpected behavior. For example, setting `resolution` to a value like {width: 1920, height: 1080} might work on some devices but fail silently on others.
